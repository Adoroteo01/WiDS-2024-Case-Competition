Note: This directory is for R packages. Packages are not tracked by git to minimize repository size. Run the following code in R to load packages. (This code is already included in the Jupyter Notebook files in the `code` directory)

```R
.libPaths("./lib")
install.packages(c("package1","package2","..."))
```
