Note: This directory is for R packages. Packages are not tracked by git to minimize repository size. Run the following code in R (file must be in the `code` directory) to load packages. (This code is already included in the Jupyter Notebook files in the `code` directory)

```R
source("lib/loadPackages.r")
```
